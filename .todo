stuff to add [i don't recommend anyone reading this because it'll all look jibberish]


commands

- channel stats
- forgot category stats
- a system to create image out of the message, if user pings message??? nvm im good with embeds using pillow is too much work it's .caption
- about memeber too maybe?
- avatar
- category stats
- quote
- caption

moderation

- unban ..maybe not have embeds? it looks fancy yes but it's not smth i'd like.. also setting up buttons and stuff requires nextcord and now changing lib is a  pain 
- purge message?
- mute
- unmute
- logging bot usage and commands!?
- create channel
- create category

invite

-idk what will i even do w this just copy pasted everything from yt a while ago



error handling

  - send error in channel itself?
  - separate error util: `os*/utils/err_handle.py`
  - maybe embed? i think i'll send normal error messages instead of embed, haven't decided yet.
  - fun fact: i can handle each error locally instead of what i've been doin' globally.

-- also ctx.channel sends message to context's default channel but that can be changed
i can modify context object maybe? and change it's behavious that way ctx.channel.send and ctx.send will have different points
i think logging will be better that way 

also the indenting is horrible (looks that way to me, maybe i should change the var, args casing?)
