stuff to add


general

- channel stats
- a system to create image out of the message, if user pings message???
- about memeber too maybe?

moderation

- unban # maybe not have embeds? it looks fancy yes but it's not smth i'd like.. also setting up buttons and stuff requires nextcord and now changing lib is a  pain 
- purge message?
- mute
- unmute
- if possible maybe add create category and channel directly too
- forgot they all have errors too so maybe fix that later as well?
- i'll have to figure out the logging system too

error handle

  - send error in channel?
  - maybe embed? i think i'll send normal error messages instead of embed
