stuff to add


general

- channel stats
- a system to create image out of the message, if user pings message???
- about memeber too maybe?
- avatar
- category stats


moderation

- unban # maybe not have embeds? it looks fancy yes but it's not smth i'd like.. also setting up buttons and stuff requires nextcord and now changing lib is a  pain 
- purge message?
- mute
- unmute
- logging bot usage and commands!?

error handling

  - send error in channel itself?
  - separate error util: `os*/utils/err_handle.py`
  - maybe embed? i think i'll send normal error messages instead of embed, haven't decided yet.
